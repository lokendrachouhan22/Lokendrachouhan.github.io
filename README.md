    <h1>Assistant Professor, Department of Electronics and Communication
Engineering, IIIT Sri City</h1>
    <p>Dr. Lokendra Chouhan (SMIEEE, MACM) is an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Sri City. Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Computer Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Center (CEMSE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), where he worked with Professor Mohamad Slim Alouni in the Communication Theory Lab (CTL).
Dr. Chouhan received his B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Rajiv Gandhi Technical University, Bhopal, India, in 2008, and his M.E. in Digital Communication from Devi Ahilya Vishwa Vidyalaya, Indore, India, in 2015. He completed his PhD in Molecular Communication from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, in 2021. Prior to his postdoctoral position at KAUST, he worked as a Senior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) from 2020 to 2021.
His current research interests span several areas, including molecular communication, wireless communications, terahertz communication, underwater acoustic communications, the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), and semantic communication. Dr. Chouhan was awarded the Visvesvaraya PhD Fellowship by the Ministry of Information and Electronics, Government of India, in 2017, in recognition of his exceptional academic achievements.
